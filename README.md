# Clock
A simple clock running on Linux using SFML

To do:
- Add support of timezones
- Autoset the system's timezone
- Add more color

On to learning about system's buitl-in timezone settings, probably somewhere in time.h, not sure

It's a graphical app, just double-click the executable in GUI file explorer, create a symlink to it and use it or type "./clock" in console while in the project directory.
