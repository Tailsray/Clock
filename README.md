# Clock
A simple clock running on Linux using SFML

To do:
- Add support of timezones
- Autoset the system's timezone
- Add fancy strokes 
- Add more color

Learning sf::Vertex and sf::VertexArray atm, that should help with drawing strokes and would be definitely useful someday later.

It's a graphical app, just double-click the executable in GUI file explorer, create a symlink to it and use it or type "./clock" in console while in the project directory.
